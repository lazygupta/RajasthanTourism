                    <h3>Jaisalmer Fort</h3>
                    <p>If geology interests you, then Jaisalmer is where you need to journey. The Wood Fossil Park or Aakal is located about 15 kilometres away from the city. Here, one can discover and trace geologic tragedies that occurred in the Thar Desert 180 million years ago. The city of Jaisalmer also acts as the guard to western Rajasthan (and India’s) frontier. This 'Golden City’ is located close to the Pakistan border and in close proximity to the Thar Desert. The city’s most prominent landmark is the Jaisalmer Fort, also called Sonar Qila (Golden Fort). Unlike most other forts in India, Jaisalmer Fort is not just a tourist attraction. It houses shops, hotels and ancient havelis (homes) where generations continue to live.</p>
                    <img src="images/J2.jpg">
                    <p>Jaisalmer traces its inception to the 12th century. History tells us of Rawal Jaisal, the eldest heir of the Rawal of Deoraj, was passed over for the throne of Lodurva and a younger half-brother was crowned king. Rawal Jaisal went looking for a new location to set up his capital when he came across sage Eesul. The sage told him about Krishna’s prophecy which said that a descendant of his Yaduvanshi clan would found a new kingdom at this same spot. It was in 1156 that Rawal Jaisal constructed a mud fort, named it Jaisalmer after himself and declared it his capital.</p>

                    <p>One of the top tourist attractions of Jaipur, the huge Amer Palace Fort sits atop a small hill, and is located at a distance about 11 km from the main city. The magnificent Amer Fort is an extensive palace complex that has been built with pale yellow and pink sandstone, and with white marble. The fort is divided into four main sections that are graced with their own courtyards.The essence of Amer Fort is encapsulated by the beautiful light and sound show within the fort, where visitors get to see an astounding spectacle about the history of the fort .</p>
                    <img src="images/Am2.jpg">
                    <p>As you arrive at the Amer Fort, you will enter through the Suraj Pol; unless you arrive by car, then you enter via the Chand Pol. Both these gates open into the Jaleb Chowk, which is the main courtyard, where in earlier times, returning armies used to display their plunder to the people. The fort has a number of sections, including the King’s quarters, the zenana (where the women lived), gardens, temples, etc.There are a lot of attractions for one to see at the Amer Fort, including the diwan-e-aam, such mandir, and the Sheesh Mahal. A part of these tunnels has been restored, and is now open to public as well. Encompassing all this, the Amer Fort is a perfect example of Rajasthani architecture which is a must-visit.</p>

                    <h3>Pushkar</h3>
                    <p>Pushkar is one of the oldest cities in India. Located to the northwest of Ajmer, the tranquil city of Pushkar is a favoured destination for thousands of tourists and devotees flocking to Rajasthan. Situated at a height of 510 metres, Pushkar is surrounded by hillocks on three sides. The ‘Nag Pahar’, literally meaning Snake Mountain forms a natural border between Ajmer and Pushkar. Known as ‘the rose garden of Rajasthan’, the essence of the famous Pushkar rose is exported all over the world. Along with an interesting mythological history, a legacy of timeless architectural heritage makes Pushkar a fascinating city.According to Hindu scriptures, the sacred Pushkar Lake is described as ‘Tirtha Raj’, the king of all pilgrimage sites. No pilgrimage is considered to be complete without a dip in in the holy Pushkar Lake.</p>
                    <img src="images/PU.2.jpg">
                    <p>According to legends, Lord Brahma, believed to be the creator of the Universe dropped a lotus to the ground leading to the immediate creation of a lake. He then decided to name the place after the flower, and thus the name, Pushkar. The city of Pushkar is home to the only temple dedicated to Lord Brahma in the whole world. Hindus consider a journey to Pushkar to be the ultimate pilgrimage that must be undertaken to attain salvation.</p>

                        <h3>Jodhpur</h3>
                        <p>Jodhpur, the second largest city in Rajasthan is popularly known as the Blue City. The name is clearly befitting as most of the architecture – forts, palaces, temples, havelis and even houses are built in vivid shades of blue. The strapping forts that tower this magnificent city sum up to a spectacle you would not want to miss. The mammoth, imposing fortress of Mehrangarh has a landscape dominating a rocky ridge with the eight gates leading out of the fortress. The new city is located outside the structure. Jodhpur is also known for the rare breed of horses known as Marwari or Malani, which are only found here. It's a bit far from the “Golden Triangle” that most people going to Northern India usually visit (New Delhi, Jaipur, and the Taj Mahal), but Jodhpur is definitely worth adding to your itinerary.</p>
                        <img src="images/JP2.jpg">
                        <p>Jodhpur marks its origin back to the year of 1459 AD. The history of this prosperous city revolves around the Rathore clan. Rao Jodha, the chief of Rathore Clan is credited with the origin of Jodhpur in India. The city is known to be built in place of the ancient capital, Mandore of the state of Manwar. Hence, the people of Jodhpur and surrounding areas are commonly known as Marwaris. Also, it is believed that the relics of Mandore can still be witnessed in the Mandore Gardens.</p>

                    <h3>Bikaner</h3>
                    <p>Bikaner is home to one of the only two models of the biplane used by the British during World War I. They were presented by the British to Maharaja Ganga Singh, then ruler of the city. Another unique aspect about Bikaner are the sand dunes that are scattered throughout the district, especially from the north-east down to the southern area. Bikaner is situated in the northern region of Rajasthan. One of the earlier established cities, Bikaner still displays its ancient opulence through palaces and forts, built of red sandstone, that have withstood the passage of time. The city boasts of some of the world’s best riding camels and is aptly nicknamed ‘camel country’. It is also home to one of the world’s largest camel research and breeding farms; as well as being known for having its own unique temple dedicated to Karni Mata at Deshnok, called the Rats Temple.Bikaner is famous for its savory Bikaneri Bhujia as it is for its sweets. It is also known for its handicrafts, leather articles and for having the biggest camel farm of Asia. The city is known for its intricately carved jharokas. These stone screens are found on the windows of forts and havelis.</p>
                    <img src="images/B2.jpg">
                    <p>The origins of Bikaner can be traced back to 1488 when a Rathore prince, Rao Bikaji, founded the kingdom. Legend has it that Bikaji, one of Rao Jodhaji’s five sons, left his father’s Durbar in annoyance after an insensitive remark from his father, the illustrious founder of Jodhpur. Bikaji travelled far and when he came upon the wilderness called Jangladesh, he decided to set up his own kingdom and transformed it into an impressive city.</p>

                    <h3>Chhitorghar</h3>
                    <p>Chittorgarh Fort has a great history behind itself, the fort has witnessed many battles. If you have time, you should definitely visit it as every fort in Rajasthan has uniqueness of its own. It has Victory Tower which is 90 feets high and then there is a famous pond and temples.Fort of chittore is partly living fort and huge . you can not do whole fort by walking you need to hire aN Auto Rikshaw or you can take a shared auto rikshwa from the lower entrance of the Fort.Historical importance of te Fort is Johar Place of Queen Padmini. victory tower & kirti stambha are other attraction.For fort of Kumbhalgarh you have to take a Car as the timing & connection are odd and it is off the route.Winter is vconsidered as the best time to visit Chhitorgarh and enjoy its beauty of Rajasthan .
                     The ideal time to visit the city of Chittorgarh is during the months of October to March. Thus, if you are planning to go for an extensive tour around the city of Chittorgarh, please visit during winter to explore all the aspects of the city.One must visit chhitorgarh and apprecite the beauty of the tourism of Rajasthan.</p>
                    <img src="images/C2.jpg">
                    <p>Chittor is a bit different from the other forts in Rajasthan in that it was a whole fortified town on top of a pinnacle of rock. The inside is now mostly in ruins but there are still a few beautiful temples etc. However, Kumbalgarh is fairly similar, in that there is a huge walled enclosure with Temples and other buildings, so although I like Chittorgarh very much and found it erie and romantic, I would not say you should go out of you way to see it if you are short of time, but it does make a lovely stop if you are travelling by car from Bundi to Udaipur.</p>

                    <h3>Bundi</h3>
                    <p>Bundi was once ruled by the Hada Chauhans. Many historians claim that it was once the capital of the great Hadoti Kingdom, which was renowned for its art and sculpture. However, in 1624, Kota separated and became an independent state and this marked the beginning of the downfall of Bundi. Whether that may be, Bundi still retains its charismatic medieval grandeur. And just like Jodhpur and Rajput, the architecture of Bundi also possesses a noticeable bluish hue, designed to keep houses cool during hot summer, in the intricately carved brackets and pillars.It is popularly believed that Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling penned part of his famous novel ‘Kim’ in Bundi. In fact, so impressed was he by the place, that this is what he wrote about the Bundi palace:
                    ‘Jaipur Palace may be called the Versailles of India … Jodhpur’s House of strife, gray towers on red rock, is the work of giants, but the Palace of Bundi, even in broad daylight, is such a palace as men build for themselves in uneasy dreams the work of goblins rather than of men.One must visit Bundi and apprecite the beauty of the tourism of Rajasthan and explore more and more about it and have some peace in their life.</p>
                    <img src="images/BU2.jpg">
                    <p>Bundi is a magnificent town located around 36 kilometres from Kota. Dotted with palaces and forts, the place has a fairy tale quality about it. Bundi’s charm lies in its location –surrounded by orchards of orange, guava, pomegranate and mango trees, flanked by the Aravalli range and rivers and lined by fields of cotton, barley and wheat. Situated far from the crowds, it is the simple rural folk that lend Bundi its allure.</p>
